* Future age calculator application 
    * Program parameters, supplied by user (dynamic):
        * person age in years 
        * years to add to age
    * Program flow:
        * When starting the program, print the two numbers
        * Then add numbers, and print to standard output
        * Then exit
    * Distribute to end user (push to github)

        * 2 questions

    * Flow - once per each question

        * hardcode 3 person votes (voted yes/no)
        * assign votes to array
        * TODO: design method for future votes counter implementation (method with empty body)
        
    * Hint: multi-dimensional array usage
    * Distribute to end user (push to github)    
    * Sample data:
        * Question 1: Is it snowing today? Yes/No
